Project: performance lab 3, Arrays

​

............  Objective  ...........

​

Tasks:

Student ages

Declare and zeroize an int array with a dimension equal to the number of students + 1

Set index 0 with the age* of the instructor

Fill the elements of the array with the ages* of the students starting with index 1

Print the array

​

Favorite quote

Declare and initialize a char array with your favorite saying

Ensure the last index is set to nul ('\0')

Separate each word in the array with a new line character ('\n' or decimal value 10)

NOTE: * use your best guess
